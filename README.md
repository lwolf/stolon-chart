# Helm chart to install Stolon (HA PostgreSQL cluster)

> Stolon is a cloud native PostgreSQL manager for PostgreSQL high availability.
> It's cloud native because it'll let you keep an high available PostgreSQL inside your containers
> (kubernetes integration) but also on every other kind of infrastructure
> (cloud IaaS, old style infrastructures etc...)

Chart is partially based on the statefullset example from the [stolon repo](https://github.com/sorintlab/stolon)

> This chart was accepted to the official kubernetes/charts repository and could be installed from there as well, but **charts are not interchangeable**.
> https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/stolon

* Kubernetes > v1.17
